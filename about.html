    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>Hi, I'm Zan.</p>
    <p>I mostly do code, namely Java and Android, with a healthy dose of Ruby, Javascript and Actionscript thrown in. That and some Scala on the side for a functional seasoning. Generally I am not picky or choosy about that. I was last seen somewhere around 51 and a half degrees latitude and zero-ish longitude, aka London.</p>
    <p>
        Currently I work at Marks at Spencer's<a href ="https://github.com/DigitalInnovation">Native Shopping apps team</a>, where we automate things that allow people to shop 24/7 from anywhere. Prior to that I was working in Staff Assisted Applications, also at M&S.
    </p>
    <p>In my spare time I am learning Scala & the principles of reactive programming using Akka and RxJava libraries.</p>
    <p>
    Prior to that I cofounded <a href="http://www.equaleyes.com">EqualEyes</a>, the company behind eponymous smartphone for the blind and visually impaired. We went through angel investment, getting the first paying users and an accellerator programme here in London.
    </p>
    <p>
    Before that I was in Slovenia, doing my masters in CS at the University of Maribor.
    </p>

    <p>
    Besides code, I like gadgets, machines, sci-fi, skiing and reading, among other things.
