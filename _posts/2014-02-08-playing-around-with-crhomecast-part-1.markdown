So I got this little bugger yesterday... it had to be ordered from eBay, as Google has decided not to sell in anywhere but USA just yet. But after seeing them posting [something about SDK going live](http://chrome.blogspot.co.uk/2014/02/chromecast-is-now-open-to-developers.html), I knew I *had to have one*. The Possibilities are quite possibly endless.

First off, I'll just go through how the setup looks like and then give you a teaser of how awesome the damn thing actually is. 



Setup
-----
Through some clever app magic, connecting a Chromecast is a charm. It worked for me in the office on a standard HDMI-enabled monitor, as well as on my home TV. Bonus points if your device has some speakers (odds are, your TV already has some!!).

Also, more bonus points if the TV has a USB port, for, while the Chromecast feels like high elven sorcery, the version currently released hasn't got the option of charging by harnessing [zero-point energy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_point_energy). I guess 32 quid will only get you so far... 

So you connect the little thing to a HDMI port like an USB dongle (so long, Virgin TV, you useless piece of crap) and via usb cable to an external power source. Then you find your Chromecast by flipping through sources. You'll eventually see a Chromecast screen with chrome logo and some numbers. Also letters. Think nice photo backgrounds and on-screen guide to set it up.

It tells you to download and fire up the [setup app](https://cast.google.com/chromecast/setup), either on your computer, tablet or phone, it only needs to be capable or wireless. How future is that, huh?

The app now guides you through several steps of first finding the Chromecast (don't worry, it has a unique identifier shown on-screen, with big letters) and then telling it what wireless to use. A simple dropdown and a password field. Of course, you can also specify a hidden wireless network if you so insist. They work perfectly fine, the only place where I had some trouble was in the office among a gajillion of devices and some seriously overworked wireless. Took a few tries but I still managed to get it running. 

*Fun fact for nerds: the setup app will actually connect to a wireless broadcast by the 'Cast and during setup you won't have no interwebs. After you try connecting it, it'll look for it on the network you specified. I found that awesome.*

Once the 'Cast is speaking to the interwebz, it will go and grab some updates, excellent time to make some coffee. In the meantime, you can also install the [Google cast extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-cast/boadgeojelhgndaghljhdicfkmllpafd?utm_source=chrome-app-launcher), but, if you're like me, you'll have had them way before the actual device even arrived in the post. 



Ok, thing is on, what do I do with it?
--------------------------------------
1. Go to [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kdgt1ZHkvnM).
2. Notice the little button that sits right of the button that goes into full screen? It says, 'Play on TV when you press it'. Press it. 
3. Click on where it says 'Cast this tab on the screen [beta]' 
4. Enjoy cats.



Uber awesome
------------
There is also the Beta option for casting the whole tab. 
So... for instance, if you go to a site like [Streamza](streamza.com/i/ksvMqsw) (my afilliate link, go to htttp://streamza dot com if you don't want to) you could, theoretically, stream videos off there. Here's a snapshot from the new film about a norse god I did, purely for science.

What's next?
------------
I'm going to start exploring the SDK and make a sample app to see how much abuse the little bugger it can take. In the Part 2 I'll have more to show. 

Also, apparently [Curry's will start officially selling them in the UK on March 1](http://www.knowyourmobile.com/google/google-chromecast/21104/google-chromecast-review-uk-release-confirmed-march-1), so not too long from now.
