Here, I said it. This is a rant post. 
Also, this is not how we're hackers and hackers use black terminal with green letters and are never leaving it, knowing all the plugins, shortcuts and shortcuts for plugins in vim/emacs, making us faster writing C and perl (or lisp) than you with your comfy Java and .NET IDEs, browsing with lynx and tweeting with curl and who knows what.

Although it's a pretty hardcore concept and I admire people doing that (looking at you, RMS), this is not the (lack of) design I meant.

I didn't mean graphic design.

#Then what IS design?

Design is the most overused word in the English dictionary.

You say design when you point at your Macbook Pro with Retina and make a smug face to your unenlightened PC friends.

Your Ikea coffee table has pretty cool laid back Swedish design.

MoMA in New York has everything, from Vespas to Helvetica, all hailed as brilliant industrial design.

Us gearheads drool at Paganis, Lambos and Ferraris as they drive past. Hell, they also designed the bloody sound!

Sipping you Frappuccino in the Dumb Starbucks, you debate flat and responive web design. 

Talking about code, we say that tests drive our design as we develop them and make them pass.

Design is repeated a lot. It's overloaded. Just saying the damn word makes 100 people think of 100, if not 200 things. 
The word is useless.

In Slovene, my mother tongue, we stole the word from English, made it conform to our writing norms and we call it 'dizajn' to be flashy and all that.

# How do we fix design?

Let's just imagine, we had words for all these terms. Like the proverbial 500 names for snow in Inuit languages. Would be nice, right? We could all be on the same page, for once. 

Truth is, we don't. And we can't push them. What we *can* do, however, is never use the bastard word alone, so it can wreak havoc. Always, and I mean *always* prepend it with that kind of design we're talking about. 

We can also take the idea from German language, and concatenate them together into one, without the space, leaving us with *graphicdesign*, *webdesign*, *industrialdesign*, *systemsdesign*, *architecturaldesign*, *codedesign*, *sounddesign*, etcetera, etcetera.

But that seems weird. Just a little off. What if, instead of just appending the word design to everything, we capitalised it first?

We'd get something like *graphicDesign*, *webDesign*, *industrialDesign*, *systemsDesign* and *codeDesign*. 

Much more readable, innit?

Do we really need engineers to fix *wordDesign* too?
