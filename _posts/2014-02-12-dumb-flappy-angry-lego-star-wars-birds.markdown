Apart from the outrage Shaun White not winning the Halfpipe competition in Sochi yesterday, there were really few other bits of news that caught my eye lately.

#The 'Dumb' bit

First one is this, the [Dumb Starbucks Coffee shop in LA](http://www.scpr.org/news/2014/02/09/42085/dumb-starbucks-coffee-shop-opens-in-los-feliz/). The idea is, that as long as you imitate something in a way that is clearly comical, you can safely use its logo, name and everything related to it. It's a work of art, anyhow. 

Also, by drinking the Dumb Starbuck Coffee, you're technically throwing away decaf soymilk latte works of art with chocholate sprinkles on top. You barbarian. 


#The 'Flappy' bit

If you haven't been living under a rock, chances are you downloaded and obsessed with this little thing called Flappy bird.

It's a super hard, helicopter-something-clone with Super Mario graphics, made in 3 days, that has driven the world crazy. So crazy in fact, the person who made it, took it down from Play and App stores, after it earned him as much as $50.000 per day in ad revenue. 

But the story gets better. After the game was taken down, [the clones appeared](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-26136781). 
There was a huge interest on sites like elance to clone the game. And so they did. 


#The 'Everything else' bit

The last thing I noticed was the Lego movie hitting theatres lately. I absolutely love Lego, but this is a franchise that has whored with almost everything that is capable even remotely of making money. 

Wow, that's almost like... that one with birds, catapults and pigs, or that one in space where they have lightsabers and that Darth Vader guy!

What if... we had a bird, wielding a lightsaber and the Force, That would have to evade Lego bricks hurled at it and destroy Pigs hurling these bricks!

Also, if you put 'Dumb' at the start, claim it's a parody and NOT get sued for it. 

It's the next Facebook, I tell you.
