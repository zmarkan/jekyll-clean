Hi, I'm Zan.

I mostly do code. Mostly Android, but lately also Actionscript and Ruby. I was last seen somewhere around 51 and a half degrees latitude and zero-ish longitude, aka London.  

Currently I work at Marks & Spencer's [Small Screen team](https://github.com/DigitalInnovation/), where we're especially good at automating everything and bacon and coffee consumption.

Previously I cofounded [EqualEyes](http://www.equaleyes.com), the company behind eponymous smartphone for the blind and visually impaired.

Before that I was in Slovenia, doing my masters in CS at the University of Maribor.

Other than that, I like my gadgets, machines and sci-fi, among other things.
